        </p>
        <p>
          Red Robot Studios processes personal information on our servers in the
          United Kingdom and in other countries. In some cases, we may process
          personal information on a server outside your own country. We may
          process personal information to provide our own&nbsp;services.
        </p>
        <h4>Choices for personal information</h4>
        <p>
          When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration,
          we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information
          in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected,
          then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than
          those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service
          privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the
          use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not
          collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those
          described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service
          privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior&nbsp;consent.

          Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can
          reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
          is being sent. However, some Red Robot Studios services may not
          function properly if your cookies are&nbsp;disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services,
          in which case Red Robot Studios may not be able to provide those
          services to&nbsp;you.
        </p>
        <h4>Information sharing</h4>
        <p>
          Currently we do not share any personal information with other
          companies or individuals outside of Red Robot Studios. However, in the
          future we may deem it necessary to share personal information with
          other companies or individuals and if so, it would be limited to the
          following&nbsp;circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of
              any sensitive personal&nbsp;information.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
              companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose
              of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that
              these parties agree to process such information based on our
              instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any
              other appropriate confidentiality and security&nbsp;measures.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
              disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)
              satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
              enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of
              Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof,
              (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
              technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the
              rights, property or safety of Red Robot Studios, its users or the
              public as required or permitted by&nbsp;law.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If Red Robot Studios becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or
              any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide
              notice before personal information is transferred and becomes
              subject to a different privacy&nbsp;policy.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated,
          non-personal information. Such information does not identify
          you&nbsp;individually.
        </p>
        <h4>Information security</h4>
        <p>
          We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorised
          access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of
          data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage
          and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical
          security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems
          where we store personal&nbsp;data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We restrict access to personal information to Red Robot Studios
          employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in
          order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals
          are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to
          discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
          fail to meet these&nbsp;obligations.
        </p>
        <h4>Data integrity</h4>
        <p>
          Red Robot Studios processes personal information only for the purposes
          for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy
          or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data
          collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only
          collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide
          or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the
          personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current,
          but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal
          information whenever&nbsp;necessary.
        </p>
        <h4>Accessing and updating personal information</h4>
        <p>
          When you use Red Robot Studios services, we make good faith efforts to
          provide you with access to your personal information and either to
          correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your
          request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for
          legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
          themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
          removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
          requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
          disproportionate technical effort, jeopardise the privacy of others,
          or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
          information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not
          otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access
          and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if
          doing so would require a disproportionate&nbsp;effort.
        </p>
        <h4>Enforcement</h4>
        <p>
          Red Robot Studios regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy
          Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding
          this Privacy Policy or Red Robot Studios’s treatment of personal
          information by contacting us through this web&nbsp;site.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we receive formal complaints, it is Red Robot Studios’s policy to
          contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will
          cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local
          data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the
          transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Red Robot
          Studios and an&nbsp;individual.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We
          will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your
          explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
          Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and,
          if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent
          notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy
          Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be
          identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will
          also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for
          your&nbsp;review.
